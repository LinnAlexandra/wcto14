Don't Fear the Custom Theme: How to build a custom WordPress theme with only four files
======

**Note:** I updated this talk in 2016, Iâ€™d recommend [using these files instead](https://github.com/LinnAlexandra/wcmtl16)! 

Slides and theme for my talk at [WordCamp Toronto 2014](http://2014.toronto.wordcamp.org). This repo contains:

- **feline-design-co**: a complete WordPress theme
- **html-site**: the original HTML and CSS template I based my theme on
- **slides**: my slide deck, with step-by-step guidelines to creating a custom theme

My slide deck is also on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/LinnAlexandra/dont-fear-the-custom-theme-how-to-build-a-custom-wordpress-theme-with-only-four-files).
